This dataset is composed of 1200 samples with 35 features each. The first column is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label.
There are 2 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric features.
Your task is the following: you should compare the performance of the k-NearestNeighbors algorithm (implemented by sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier) with that of Logistic Regression (implemented by sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression).
Try to optimize both algorithms' parameters and determine which one is best for this dataset. 

At the end of the analysis, you should have chosen an algorithm and its optimal set of parameters: write this choice explicitly in the conclusions of your notebook.
Your notebook should detail the procedure you have used to choose the optimal parameters (graphs are a good idea when possible/sensible).

You will also be given a test set where to test the predictions of your model.
